# Scroll to Top

The **Scroll To Top** button allows users to quickly return to the top of a webpage with a single click. This feature enhances the browsing experience on sites with longer content by saving time and reducing the effort required to manually scroll back up.

To show it on your site go to **Appearance** -> **Customize** -> **General** -> **Scroll to Top** and enable it first.

After you enable it, it will be visible on entire site whenever the defined conditions for showing the button are met.&#x20;

You can choose to show the scroll to top button in three ways:

1. When user reaches **the footer**
2. When users scroll to certain percentage of the scroll
3. When users scroll a specific number of pixels
