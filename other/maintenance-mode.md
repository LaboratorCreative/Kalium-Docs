# Maintenance Mode

With Kalium, there’s no need to install extra plugins to display a maintenance message on your site. While you’re working on your site, you can simply activate Maintenance Mode to let visitors know that your site will be back soon.

To do that go to **Appearance** -> **Customize** -> **General** -> **Maintenance Mode** and enable maintenance mode:

There are several options you can set for this mode:

* **Page Title** - The title display both on browser title bar and as main heading in the page.
* **Description** - Optional explaining text for the maintenance mode.
* **Custom Logo** - Adds your logo above the title, if no logo is assigned it will use current logo from your brand.
* **Countdown Timer** - An interactive timer that counts down to the date of launch of your site.
* **Social Networks** - Shows your defined social networks in the bottom of the page.
* **Style Options** - Background and text color as well as custom image for the background.
