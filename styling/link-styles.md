# Link Styles

Links inside pages, blog posts and other related entry content can have custom link animation / style, which can be edited on **Appearance** -> **Customizer** -> **Styling** -> **Link Styles**

The default link style is Animated Underline which dates back from very first version of Kalium but you can change them to your preferred style and animation.

Every link style has its own set of options which you can set for individual styling.

### Standard

This type of link style is common on all websites. It makes plain links with default underline styling applied by the browser and has no custom options.

### Underline

This type of link style is more advanced in terms of appearance and options.&#x20;

It can be Static or Animated underline. You can set custom **direction** for underline animation, **thickness**, **position** and **color**.

A common option is to make everything go in reverse animation by toggling **Reverse State** option.

This link style swaps the link in two directions **Top** and **Bottom**.

### Fill

This link style has two types: **Background** and **Text**.&#x20;

Background type sets the filling animation in specified direction: **top**, **bottom**, **left** and **right**.&#x20;
