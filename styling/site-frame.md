# Site Frame

Site frame is an optional feature that can be added to your site where it adds a border around your entire site. It is usually used by creative sites which want to have an unique experience of showcasing their services / products.

To enable the Site Frame go to **Appearance** -> **Customize** -> **Styling** -> **Site Frame** and click the toggle on the right to enable it:
