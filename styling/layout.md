# Layout

Layout options allow you to set the container size for the entire site and adjust block spacing.

To edit the layout options go to **Appearance** -> **Customizer** -> **Styling** -> **Layout**

### Container Width

There are three predefined widths you can set for the container size:&#x20;

* **Large -** Maximum width is 1296 pixels.
* **Medium** - _Default_, maximum width is 1116 pixels.
* **Small** - Maximum width is 936 pixels.
* **Custom** - User defined maximum width

If you want to set a full width for the container check the above option **Full Width Container** toggle.

### Block Spacing

Block Spacing controls the space between two blocks. It is especially useful for nested blocks, like images within a Gallery block. Setting the Block Spacing to zero removes the gap between blocks, while leaving it empty uses the default spacing.

You can choose between **8 predefined block spacings** but also set your preferred spacing value which is responsive friendly:

### Container Width on Single Page

If you want custom container size on page level (not entire site) you can do this by clicking **Edit Page** or  **Edit Post** (whatever single page):

Go to **Parameters and Options** -> **Page Options** -> **Other Settings**
