# Settings

Template Parts in Kalium have a dedicated settings panel that lets you control how and where your content appears on your site. Depending on the type of Template Part you're creating (Section, Header, Footer, or Page), the available settings may vary.

In this article, we’ll walk through the main parts of this panel — including how to open it and switch between Template Part types.

## Settings Panel

To open the Template Part settings, click the **Kalium icon** in the top-right corner while editing a Template Part.

This will toggle the settings panel on the right side of the editor. From here, you can configure all available options for your Template Part.
