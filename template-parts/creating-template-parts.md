# Creating Template Parts

Now that youâ€™ve learned what Template Parts are and how they work, itâ€™s time to start creating one. Whether youâ€™re adding a custom section, replacing your siteâ€™s footer, or building a new layout for your 404 page, the process is simple and familiar.

Template Parts are managed from one place in your WordPress admin â€” and the interface works just like creating a regular post or page, so itâ€™ll feel familiar right away.

To get started, go to **Kalium â†’ Template Parts** in your dashboard.

### Types of Template Parts

There are four types of Template Parts you can create:

* **Sections** â€“ Insert content into specific areas of your site using WordPress and plugin hook locations, like before the header, after the content, or between elements on WooCommerce pages.
* **Headers** â€“ Use a custom header instead of the default site header.
* **Footers** â€“ Swap out the footer based on the page, user, or even date.
* **Pages** â€“ Replace the layout of pages like 404, search results, category archives, and more.

Each type has a specific purpose, and you can create as many as you need depending on the parts of your site you want to customize.

### Tabs Overview

At the top of the Template Parts screen, youâ€™ll see a set of tabs that help you filter, organize and view different types of Template Parts.

These tabs make it easier to find what youâ€™re working on, especially if you have a lot of Template Parts.

> ðŸ’¡ When adding a new Template Part, itâ€™s helpful to switch to the tab that matches what youâ€™re creating (like **Sections**) before clicking **Add New**. The type will be set automatically based on the tab youâ€™re in â€” but you can still change it later if needed.

Now that youâ€™ve seen how Template Parts are organized and where to find them, letâ€™s go ahead and create our first one.
