# Creating Template Parts

Now that you’ve learned what Template Parts are and how they work, it’s time to start creating one. Whether you’re adding a custom section, replacing your site’s footer, or building a new layout for your 404 page, the process is simple and familiar.

Template Parts are managed from one place in your WordPress admin — and the interface works just like creating a regular post or page, so it’ll feel familiar right away.

To get started, go to **Kalium → Template Parts** in your dashboard.

### Types of Template Parts

There are four types of Template Parts you can create:

* **Section** – Insert content into specific areas of your site using WordPress and plugin hook locations, like before the header, after the content, or between elements on WooCommerce pages.
* **Header** – Use a custom header instead of the default site header.
* **Footer** – Swap out the footer based on the page, user, or even date.
* **Page** – Replace the layout of pages like 404, search results, category archives, and more.

Each type has a specific purpose, and you can create as many as you need depending on the parts of your site you want to customize.

### Tabs Overview

At the top of the Template Parts screen, you’ll see a set of tabs that help you filter, organize and view different types of Template Parts.

These tabs make it easier to find what you’re working on, especially if you have a lot of Template Parts.

{% hint style="info" %}
When adding a new Template Part, it’s helpful to switch to the tab that matches what you’re creating (like **Sections**) before clicking **Add New**. The type will be set automatically based on the tab you’re in — but you can still change it later if needed.

Now that you’ve seen how Template Parts are organized and where to find them, let’s go ahead and create our first one.
