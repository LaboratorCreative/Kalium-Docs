# Types

There are four types of Template Parts you can create:

* **Sections** – Insert content into specific areas of your site using WordPress and plugin hook locations, like before the header, after the content, or between elements on WooCommerce pages.
* **Headers** – Use a custom header instead of the default one.
* **Footers** – Swap out the footer based on the page, user, or even date.
* **Pages** – Replace the layout of pages like 404, search results, category archives, and more.
