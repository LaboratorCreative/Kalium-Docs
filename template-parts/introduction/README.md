# Introduction

Ever wanted to show a special section only on product pages? Or maybe use a different footer during a sale? Even replace the default 404 page with something more helpful or on-brand? That’s what Template Parts are for.

They let you display custom content in specific areas of your site, exactly where and when you want. No coding needed, and you can build everything using the page builder you're already comfortable with: Gutenberg, Elementor, or WPBakery.

Here are some examples of Template Parts and how they can help:

* Show a banner above the header during a holiday sale
* Use a simpler footer on checkout and thank-you pages
* Display a different header when users are logged in
* Customize your blog category layout with a unique design
* Add a call-to-action after product descriptions
* Replace the default 404 page with something more useful

Template Parts are flexible, reusable, and give you a powerful way to personalize your site — all while keeping things easy to manage.

### Enabling or Disabling Template Parts

Template Parts are enabled by default when you install Kalium. If you ever need to turn them off or back on:

1. Go to **Kalium → Settings** in your WordPress admin.
2. On the left sidebar, click **Template Parts**.
3. Use the toggle switch to enable or disable the feature.

This gives you the flexibility to turn the feature off if you're not using it, and re-enable it later when needed.
