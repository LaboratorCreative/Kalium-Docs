# Settings

Template Parts in Kalium have a dedicated settings panel that lets you control how and where your content appears on your site. Depending on the type of Template Part you're creating (Section, Header, Footer, or Page), the available settings may vary.

In this article, we’ll walk through the main parts of this panel — including how to open it and switch between Template Part types.

***

### Accessing the Settings Panel

To open the Template Part settings, click the **Kalium icon** in the top-right corner while editing a Template Part.

This will toggle the settings panel on the right side of the editor. From here, you can configure all available options for your Template Part.

***

### Type: Choose What You're Creating

At the top of the panel, you’ll see the **Type** dropdown. This defines the kind of Template Part you’re working on:

* **Section** – Used to inject content into hook locations across the site.
* **Header** – Replaces the default site header.
* **Footer** – Replaces the default footer.
* **Page** – Replaces entire pages like 404, search results, or archives.

The rest of the settings — including Display Conditions, Placement, and Container Settings — are explained in separate articles.
