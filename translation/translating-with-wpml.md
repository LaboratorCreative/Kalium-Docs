# Translating with WPML

Kalium is fully compatible with WPML, a leading paid plugin for creating multilingual WordPress sites. WPML enhances WordPress by allowing you to translate your content into multiple languages, making it ideal for global websites. You can purchase WPML separately to make your website multilingual.

We've had a great experience working with WPML across our themes, including Aurum and Oxygen. When we released Kalium, we partnered with WPML again to ensure seamless compatibility. Kalium is [certified and tested](https://wpml.org/theme/kalium/?aid=150643\&affiliate_key=VWCj6GPGWxBE) by the WPML team.

Kalium ranks among the top 20 most-used themes with WPML, and WPML has published documentation on building multilingual websites using Kalium. You can view the article here: [How to translate Kalium theme using WPML](https://wpml.org/documentation/theme-compatibility/translating-kalium-theme-using-wpml/?aid=150643\&affiliate_key=VWCj6GPGWxBE).

### Getting Started

WPML offers three versions: Multilingual Blog, Multilingual CMS and Multilingual Agency plan. We highly recommend the **Multilingual CMS** version for its extensive features, including translation management capabilities. The **Multilingual Blog** version does not include String Translation and translation management components.

Ensure that you have the WPML Multilingual CMS, String Translation, and Media Translation\* plugins installed and activated.
