# RTL Languages

Kalium is designed to be versatile and accessible for users worldwide, including those who use [RTL languages](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] — such as Arabic and Hebrew. They are written and read from right to left. Kalium fully supports RTL, ensuring that your site looks and functions perfectly, regardless of the language direction.

### Enabling RTL on Your Site

Setting up Kalium for an RTL language is straightforward. Here’s how to enable RTL on your WordPress site:

1. **Change Site Language**:
   * In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **Settings** **->** **General**.
   * Scroll down to the **Site Language** section.
   * Select the RTL language you want from the dropdown menu _(e.g., Arabic or Hebrew)_.
2. **Translate Your Site**:
   * Once the RTL language is selected, you’ll need to translate the theme strings and site content into the chosen language.
3. **Verify Your RTL Setup**:
   * Visit your site to see the RTL layout in action. Kalium will automatically adjust the layout and align content to match the RTL reading direction.
