# Creating a Blog Page

By default, WordPress allows you to designate a page as your blog, which then serves as a dynamic feed for your posts. This means that whenever you publish a new post, it automatically appears on this page, keeping your content organized and easily accessible for your readers.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to create and set up your blog page in WordPress. We’ll cover everything from creating the page to configuring it as your posts page. With a few simple steps, you'll have your blog up and running, ready to showcase your latest content and engage with your audience.

If you don’t want to use the default homepage as your blog page and prefer to create a separate page for your blog, follow these steps:

1. In the WordPress sidebar, go to **Pages** **->** **Add New**.
2. Enter a title for your blog page. Common titles include **"Blog"**, **"Thoughts"**, or **"News"**.
   * Optionally, add a description to introduce your blog or provide context for your readers.
3. Click **Publish** to make your blog page live on your site.

## Setting Your Blog Page as the Posts Page

After creating your blog page, you need to designate it as the page that will display your blog posts:

1. Navigate to **Settings** **->** **Reading** in the WordPress sidebar.
2. In the **Front page displays** section, select **A static page (select below)**.
3. In the **Posts page** dropdown menu, choose the blog page you created earlier.
4. Click **Save Changes** to apply the settings.
