# Design Your Own

This layout allows for extensive customization using any page builder of your choice, such as Block Editor, Elementor, or WPBakery. By leveraging these tools, you can design and configure your content directly within the page builder interface, offering a high degree of flexibility and control.&#x20;

This method enables you to craft a unique and tailored presentation for each portfolio item, utilizing the full range of features and widgets provided by your selected page builder.

Unlike other item types, this layout does not come with predefined configuration options in Parameters and Options. Instead, you manage all aspects of the itemâ€™s design and functionality through the page builder itself.&#x20;

This approach provides a seamless integration with your chosen builder, allowing you to customize the layout, add content, and apply styles without being constrained by additional settings outside the builder environment.
