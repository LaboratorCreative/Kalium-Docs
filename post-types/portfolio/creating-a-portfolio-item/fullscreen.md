# Fullscreen

Fullscreen item type offers an immersive viewing experience by allowing the gallery to occupy the entire viewport, creating a strong focus on the visual content. This layout is particularly effective for showcasing high-impact images or videos where every detail matters.

In this layout, the description can be set to be collapsed or expanded by default, or hidden entirely, depending on your preference. Itâ€™s fully responsive, ensuring that the same impactful experience is maintained across all devices, including mobile.

## Fullscreen Options

Here, you can adjust the visibility and display of the description and project information. Available options include:

### Content Box State

The content box has three states: _Collapsed_, _Expanded_, or _Hidden_. By default, the content box is Collapsed, but you can set it to _Expanded_ using the Item **Description Visibility** option. To hide the content box entirely, enable the **Hide Project Description** option.

<div><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Fullscreen - Content Box State - Collapsed.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Collapsed content</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Fullscreen - Content Box State - Expanded.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Expanded content</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Fullscreen - Content Box State - Hidden.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Hidden content</p></figcaption></figure></div>

You can also customize the text for the expand handle in the **Show Project Info** text field.

## Project Gallery

You can customize your Project Gallery with several options, including:

* **Auto Play:** Set the number of seconds for automatic slide transitions. Leave empty to disable.
