# Zig Zag

The Zig Zag item type presents a distinctive layout where content and gallery items alternate in a zigzag pattern, creating a dynamic visual flow. This layout is ideal for showcasing items in a staggered fashion, enhancing visual interest and engagement.

This item type offers similar options to the [Side Portfolio](side-portfolio.md) layout, with additional gallery item settings such as description content, width, and alignment.
