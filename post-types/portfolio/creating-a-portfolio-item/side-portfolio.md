# Side Portfolio

This layout features a horizontal separation between the gallery and the content, creating a side-by-side arrangement. The gallery is displayed alongside the project content, offering a clear distinction between visual and textual information.

These options are specific to this portfolio type and allow further customization of the layout.

### Content Alignment

By default, the content is aligned to the left. To change this, set the **Item Description Alignment** to **Right**. Additionally, you can adjust the width of the content container using the **Item Description Width** setting which be one of the followings: _50% (1/2)_, _33% (1/3)_ or _25% (1/4)_ of the wrapper container width.

### Sticky Description

The description for the item can be set to stick to the top of the viewport, just below the header if it is sticky. Enable the **Sticky Description** option to keep the content aligned with the gallery while scrolling, enhancing the viewing experience.

### Stretched Gallery Container

For a fullscreen gallery experience, you can stretch the gallery items to the edge of the viewport. Select the **Full Background** option in the **Gallery Type** to enable this feature and make the gallery extend to the full width and height of the viewport:

The result after enabling stretched gallery:

Please note that this effect is only visible on larger screens; on mobile devices, the gallery will retain its normal behavior.

### Gallery Columns Layout

The gallery columns layout can be adjusted to use Masonry style of positioning items by enabling **Masonry Mode Gallery**. This will align the items and removes any unused gap:

The Project Gallery section lets you add various media types, including:

* **Single Image**: Display a single image in your gallery. This is ideal for showcasing individual visuals or key elements of your project.
* **Slider Images**: Add a slider containing multiple images. This allows viewers to scroll through a series of images, which is useful for showing different angles or stages of your project.
* **Image Comparison**: Use an interactive slider to compare two images side by side. This is particularly effective for before-and-after shots or contrasting different design options.
* **Video**: Embed videos from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo, or use self-hosted video files. Videos can include project demonstrations, tutorials, or any other relevant content.
* **Text Quote**: Insert a text quote or message. This can be used to highlight key feedback, project descriptions, or significant statements related to your work.
* **HTML Code**: Add custom HTML to include additional elements such as interactive widgets, forms, or any other bespoke features that enhance your gallery.

These options allow you to create a versatile and engaging gallery for each portfolio item, showcasing your work in a dynamic and interactive manner.

To add a gallery item, click **Add New** and select from the available media types:
