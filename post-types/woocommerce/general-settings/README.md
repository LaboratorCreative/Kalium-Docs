### Add to Cart Behaviour

Set the action that occurs after a product is added to the cart. This setting determines how your store responds when customers add items to their shopping carts, enhancing their overall shopping experience.

* **None**: No additional action is taken after a product is added to the cart. Customers will remain on the same page, allowing them to continue shopping without interruption.
* **Show Mini Cart**: Displays the mini cart, which provides a quick preview of the items added to the cart. This option can enhance the shopping experience by giving customers immediate feedback about their cart contents and allowing them to view and access their cart without leaving the current page.
