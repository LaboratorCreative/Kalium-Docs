# License

{% hint style="info" %}
This section focuses on the license as integrated mechanism into the theme, rather than the legal aspects of licensing.&#x20;

It explains how the license controls theme functionality, including the allowed number of activations, theme updates, starter site imports, bundled plugin installations, and support, as well as how to manage your license within our platform.

When you purchase the Kalium theme, your license comes with specific terms and restrictions based on the plan you selected.&#x20;

This license controls how you can use the theme, including updates, importing starter sites, installing or updating required plugins, and getting support.&#x20;

Understanding these restrictions and the number of allowed activations is essential for effectively managing your licenses.&#x20;

### License Activations

The number of license activations allowed is subject of the plan you selected at the time of purchase. Each plan specifies how many sites you can activate the theme on, and itâ€™s [important to understand these limits](activation-scope.md). Be sure to review the details of your chosen plan to understand the activation limits and manage your licenses accordingly.
