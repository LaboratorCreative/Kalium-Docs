# Hosting and Domain

Choosing the right hosting provider is crucial for getting the most out of our themes. It’s important to pick a WordPress-friendly host that fits your needs in terms of location, pricing, and services.

While we don’t offer hosting services ourselves, we can recommend some great options. Check out our [Recommendations Page](https://kaliumtheme.com/recommendations/) to find a hosting provider that works for you.

From our experience, we suggest avoiding basic or shared hosting plans, as they often lack the necessary features and resources. These plans can lead to issues like failed starter site imports, problems with plugins, and incomplete page rendering.

To get the best performance with Kalium, select a hosting plan that meets the minimum [server requirements](server-requirements.md).
