# Customizer

The Customizer is where you can edit Kaliumâ€™s look and functionality. It allows you to adjust theme options such as colors, layouts, and widget placements. With real-time previews, you can see how changes affect your site before applying them, making it easy to customize the theme to fit your design preferences.

Changes made in the Customizer can be scheduled and drafted according to your preferences, or published immediately. This feature enables you to plan and prepare updates in advance, ensuring that your site reflects the desired changes at the right time without immediate publication.

### How to Start Customizing

To access the Customizer, simply go to **Appearance** -> **Customize** from the WordPress Admin menu.

You can use the search function to quickly navigate to your desired sections or options.

Each control option is self-explanatory, and for additional information, you can hover over the question mark icon <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Customizer Questionmark.jpg" alt="" data-size="line">  to read more about the function of that setting.

Responsive controls are located at the bottom of the Customizer, allowing you to switch between device viewports and preview changes within the site frame.

### Responsive Controls

Responsive controls feature an icon representing different device screens.&#x20;

Clicking this icon allows you to switch between viewports such as _Desktop_, _Tablet_, and _Mobile_. Any values you enter are applied specifically to the selected viewport.&#x20;

Values are inherited from _Desktop_ -> _Tablet_ -> _Mobile_, meaning that if you set a value for _Desktop_, it will also apply to _Mobile_ unless you specify a different value for _Mobile_. However, setting a value for _Mobile_ will not override the _Desktop_ or _Tablet_ settings.
