# Sticky Header

The Sticky Header feature allows the header to remain fixed at the top of the page while users scroll. This ensures that essential navigation elements and branding are always visible, providing consistent access to menu options and improving the overall browsing experience on longer pages.

To enable the _Sticky Header_, navigate to **Appearance -> Customize -> Header** and activate the **Sticky Header** option. Click on the option to access and adjust its settings.​

### Sticky Logo

Our sticky header implementation allows resizing _current logo_ when entering the _sticky state_, or completely switching the logo to another image.

**Custom Logo**\
To display a different image for the sticky header, enable this option and then select or upload your preferred sticky logo image.​&#x20;

**Logo Width**\
If you set only the logo width, it will resize the existing site logo when the header becomes sticky. If a custom logo is added, the width will be applied to the new image instead.

### Auto Hide

This option changes the sticky header behavior to only appear when users scroll up on page within a threshold of 50-100 pixels. To enable it toggle the **Auto Hide** option.

**Animate on Scroll**\
The animation timeline is controlled by the scrollbar progress.​ Otherwise it will play animation right after entering the sticky state.

**Smooth Transition**\
Applicable when “Animate on Scroll” is enabled; if the scroll speed is fast, the animation will progress more slowly to appear smoother.

**Initial Offset**\
Scroll position when sticky header styles begin animation.

***

### Responsive

The sticky header also includes responsive options, allowing you to enable or disable it for specific devices.
