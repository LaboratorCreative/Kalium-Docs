The header is a versatile and integral part Kalium, offering a range of customization options to suit any design preference. It serves as the primary navigation and branding area, and with its extensive layout possibilities, you can create a header that complements your site’s overall aesthetics.

This flexible structure allows you to create a header that seamlessly integrates with your site’s design and enhances its functionality.

To customize the header go to **Appearance -> Customize -> Header**

You can choose between pre-defined header types (or layouts): **Standard**, **Fullscreen**, **Off-Canvas Side**, **Off-Canvas Top** or build your own layout with **Custom** header type. The upcoming sections will guide you through the process of creating each header type.

### Structure of Header

The header can be organized into three distinct rows, each serving a unique purpose:

* Top Row (Top Bar)
* Main Row
* Bottom Row

Each row can be customized to align with your design preferences.

### Logo Placement

The logo is placed in the _**main row**_ of the header, with a default alignment to the left (or right for RTL sites).&#x20;

It will appear as configured in your settings under [**Appearance -> Customize -> Styling -> Brand**](../../styling/brand-and-logo.md).
