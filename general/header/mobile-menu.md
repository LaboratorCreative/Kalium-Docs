# Mobile Menu

The Mobile Menu provides a streamlined navigation experience for smaller screens. It features a collapsible, touch-friendly interface with a hamburger icon that toggles the menu at the defined mobile menu breakpoint.

You can edit the Mobile Menu by going to **Appearance -> Customize -> Header -> Mobile Menu**.​

The menu content is divided into two sections: _Main Content_ and _Footer Content_. This structure allows you to add items to the end of the mobile menu container, making them easily accessible while on mobile devices.

Like other header sections, the mobile menu uses a drag-and-drop interface to organize and structure the menu elements.

The mobile menu offers a slightly smaller selection of elements, as not all elements available in other header sections are supported in the mobile menu.​

To add elements simply click :heavy\_plus\_sign: **Add** link in one of content containers and the list of elements will show up.

### Menu Options

You can adjust the behavior and style of the mobile menu by accessing the options in the Mobile Menu section. Scroll down to the **Menu Options** section to make your changes.:
