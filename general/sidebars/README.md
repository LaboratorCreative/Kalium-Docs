Kalium offers extensive options to customize the sidebars on your website, allowing you to create the perfect layout for your content. The sidebar settings can be accessed by navigating to **Appearance -> Customizer -> Sidebars** in your WordPress dashboard. Below is a detailed guide to the different customization options available for sidebars in Kalium.

### Sidebar Types

Kalium provides two distinct types of sidebars, each offering different design capabilities:

* **Type 1:** This is a traditional sidebar without any background or border. It's ideal for a clean, minimalist look.
* **Type 2:** This type allows you to add more design elements, such as a background, border, border radius, and shadow, giving you greater control over the appearance of your sidebar.

### Sidebar Options

#### Sidebar Width

You can set the width of the sidebar as a percentage of the overall page width. This allows you to control how much space the sidebar occupies relative to the main content area.

#### Sidebar Gap

This setting controls the gap between the sidebar and the main content. Adjusting this can help to create a more balanced layout.

#### Inner Spacing _(Type 2)_

Allows you to define the inner spacing (padding) within the sidebar or widget if they are separated. It’s useful for ensuring that your sidebar content has enough breathing room.

#### Widget Vertical Spacing

This option sets the gap between individual widgets within the sidebar. It helps maintain consistent spacing and a clean look.

#### Separate Widgets _(Type 2)_

Allows you to separate each widget within the sidebar, giving them a distinct appearance.

#### Mobile Position

This setting lets you choose whether the sidebar should appear at the top or bottom of the page when viewed on mobile devices.

### Sticky Sidebar

Kalium offers a sticky sidebar feature that keeps the sidebar visible as the user scrolls down the page. You can toggle this feature on or off and customize it with the following options:

* **Sticky Behaviour:**&#x20;
  * Entire Sidebar: The entire sidebar remains sticky.
  * Widget&#x73;**:** Set the number of the bottom widgets that you want to remain sticky.
* **Offset from Top:** This setting controls the distance from the top of the page when the sidebar becomes sticky.

### Responsive Visibility

You can control whether the sidebar is visible on different devices by toggling the respective options:

* Desktop
* Tablet
* Mobile
