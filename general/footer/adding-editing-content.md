# Adding/Editing Content

The footer content can be edited in two places:

1. **Appearance -> Widgets**
2. **Appearance -> Customize -> Widgets**

If you need guidance on adding widgets, [this article](../sidebars/troubleshooting-sidebar.md#adding-widgets-to-your-sidebar) provides a detailed explanation.

Once you’ve defined the footer structure and assigned widget areas, you can easily make edits directly in **Widgets** page without needing to go to the **Customizer** to save changes.

### Footer Widget Areas

Widgets locations that you can use in the footer are **Footer Widget Area 1** to **Footer Widget Area 6**:

The content formatting and everything Block Editor offers can be constructed here.&#x20;

With this approach, you can add any type of element to the footer, including images, maps, contact forms, and other content supported by the _Block Editor_ and the plugins that extend it.

When editing multiple widget locations, make sure to click the **Update** button after each widget location edit. WordPress only saves changes for the current widget area, so if you edit multiple areas without saving, your work may be lost.
{% endhint %}

### Multi-Column Widget Area

The widget content flows vertically by default, but you can still organize it into columns for a more structured layout.

You can add as many groups as needed in the widget area, and in the Customizer’s **Footer** section, you can configure these widgets to split into columns.&#x20;

This setup supports varying column numbers on different responsive viewports.​

Then in the **Appearance -> Customize -> Footer** section, set the number of **Widgets per Row** for **Footer Widget Area 3**:

Do not confuse the _**Column**_ element with _widget columns_, as it is mainly used for structuring the footer layout.
