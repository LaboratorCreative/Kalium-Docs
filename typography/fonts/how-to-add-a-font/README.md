### 4. Select Variants

On the right side, you’ll see the variant selector. Choose the specific variant of the font you wish to use, such as Regular, Bold, or Italic. If you don’t need a particular variant, it’s best not to select it, as unnecessary variants can impact your site’s performance.

### 5. Apply the Font

Decide where you want the font to be applied, such as "Sitewide," "Headings," or "Paragraphs." By default, the font will be applied sitewide. If you want to use different fonts for different sections, you can customize the settings to apply one font to headings and another to paragraphs, or adjust as needed.

That’s all for the basic font setup. Be sure to save your changes by clicking the **Save Changes** button. The additional options available, such as Conditional Loading and Overwriting Font Settings, are more advanced and not necessary for loading a font but can be explored if you need more control over font management.
