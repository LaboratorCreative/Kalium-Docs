## Display Conditions

Display Conditions let you control **where** and **when** a Template Part appears on your site.

You can choose specific rules to include or exclude areas of your site, based on page type, user role, WooCommerce state, date, and more. This gives you full control over the visibility of your section, header, footer, or page ‚Äî without needing to write a single line of code.

***

### How to Add Conditions

While editing a Template Part, click the **Kalium icon** in the top-right corner to open the settings panel.

1. Scroll to the **Display Conditions** section
2. Click **Add Condition**
3. Choose the type of condition (e.g. General Page, Single Post, etc.)
4. Define the rule and select the target

You can add multiple conditions and group them using **AND** and **OR** to create more advanced logic.

> Example: Show a banner only on product pages **AND** for logged-in users
